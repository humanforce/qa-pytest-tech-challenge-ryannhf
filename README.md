# Tech Test for QA Applications

As part of the hiring process, we ask you to demonstrate some skills with automation by producing a test suite that automates a series of user workflows. You should also include any tests that you believe would be relevant but are not covered below, however focus on the objective of the user story and what it is trying to verify.
Please cover as many user stories as you can, whilst maintaining good readability and reusable codes. It's better you have a functional automated test suite rather than a framework with only 1 or 2 automated tests.

**Requirements:**
  - We request that you use a Python automation framework. Humanforce uses PyTest.
  - Please respond to this assessment with a code package, preferably hosted in a git repository.
  - Automated tests should run in headless mode.
  - Automated tests should be executable by a single command (e.g., pytest --pyargs package_name).

Spend no more than 4 hours on this assessment. It is not intended that you achieve 100% coverage in this time period. We would like to see what you can do in 4 hours' time.

**Note: Account credentials for the tenant will be provided to you separately.**

**Note: You might see introductory popup windows the first time you open up certain pages, these can be closed before running the test.**

Bonus points (if you have capacities to do all of these, you are more than welcome to show us your skills and experience):

- Code is clean and easy to read.
- Language is in Python
- Use Page Object Model style for the project.
- Functions that are repeated are stored in a helper file and referenced as necessary.
- Failed tests are retried a few times before failing.
- Documentation and comments as required.
- Tests can be retried multiple time without failing.
- Password are stored in a separate file (using dot env)
